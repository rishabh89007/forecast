Why Natural Gas Storage Data?
The weekly natural gas storage data is a principal federal economic indicator used by the public to determine natural gas inventory levels, indicators of the balance between supply and demand in the natural gas market. 
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, upon release of the report, the natural gas market reacts to the derived net change in inventory levels from the prior week that often influences natural gas prices.
